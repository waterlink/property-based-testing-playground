# Property Based Testing Playground

This is the repository for some Property Based Testing researching to do.

There are implementations of 3 following functions:

- `add(x, y)`
- `mul(x, y)`
- `sort(array)` or `sort(list)`

Currently there are following programming languages covered:

- [Clojure](/clj),
- [Crystal](/crystal),
- [Golang](/go),
- [Haskell](/haskell), and
- [Ruby](/ruby).

Feel free to explore and send a Pull Request adding other programming
languages, that have support for property based testing.
